# MEV_Sandwich_Mitigation_Protocol

This project addresses the pressing issue of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and its specific manifestation in the form of Sandwich Attacks within the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Leveraging the features introduced in Uniswap V4, particularly the usage of action hooks, we propose a novel protocol solution aimed at mitigating these attacks. The methodology involves the detection of potentially malicious transactions at the contract layer and places them in an intermediate state, pending further analysis. Our solution seeks to balance heightened security measures with user experience. Empirical data support the urgency and feasibility of implementing this protocol to protect users from financial losses and ensure a fair and secure trading environment.
